For this assignment, I chose the Discourse Studies Journal. The scope of this journal is discourse analysis and the structures and strategies of text and talk. The journal also looks at the cultural, political, and social functions of discourse. The questions I am trying to answer by choosing this journal for my topic model is to see how certain words co-occur based on critical approaches to language. I also wanted to see how my assumptions of certain words aligned with the connections they had in the topic model.
